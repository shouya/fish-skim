# fish-skim

This project simply takes skim's fish [key binding config](https://github.com/lotabout/skim/blob/master/shell/key-bindings.fish) out of
[skim project](https://github.com/lotabout/skim) and make it into a standalone repository.

This way you may install the config independently with fish package managers without the hassle of keeping the config up to date on your own.

## Installation

```
fisher add shouya/fish-skim
```

## LICENSE
